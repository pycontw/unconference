## 如何投稿？How to Propose?
我們採用 GitHub 的 Issues 功能作為非正式會議的投稿及投票系統，因此**發起一個新的 issue** 即為投稿非正式會議。以下是您在投稿時需要填入的資訊：

- Issue 標題即為您的**講題**
- Issue 內容即為您的**摘要**。例如：您會在會議中涵蓋什麼樣的議題？希望什麼樣的會眾來參與？您想和會眾有什麼樣的互動？
- 若有額外的備註，請直接寫在 issue 說明裡。

We're going to use GitHub's Issues feature as our proposal and voting system for the unconference, so **opening a new issue** is proposing an unconference talk. There are a few things you'll have to fill in when you propose:

- Issue's title is your proposal's **title**.
- Issue's description is your proposal's **abstract**. e.g. What will you cover in your speech/discussion? What's your target audience? What kind of interaction would you like to have with the crowd?
- If you have any external footnotes, please also include them inside the issue's description.

## 如何投票？How to Vote?
如同上述，我們使用 GitHub 的 Issues 功能作為非正式會議的投稿及投票系統，因此**對一個 issue 作出 "+1 reaction"** (👍) 即計為一票。您可以投票給多個稿件，且 +1 以外的任何 reactions 皆不計數。

As described above, we're using GitHub's Issues feature as our proposal and voting system, so **adding a "+1 reaction" (👍) against an issue** counts as a vote. You can vote for multiple proposals, and all the reactions other than "+1" don't count.
